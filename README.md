# STUDENT DEPRESSION & LIFESTYLE DASHBOARD

---

## 📌 Abstract

Mental health issues among students have become a critical concern in recent years due to academic pressure, lifestyle changes, excessive use of social media, and lack of proper sleep and physical activity. This project, titled **Student Depression & Lifestyle Dashboard**, aims to analyze student lifestyle patterns and their relationship with depression using data analytics and visualization techniques.

The project uses a structured dataset containing academic, lifestyle, and mental health indicators such as CGPA, sleep duration, physical activity, study hours, social media usage, stress level, gender, department, and depression status. A dynamic and interactive dashboard is developed to visually represent insights and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This dashboard helps in identifying trends, patterns, and risk factors associated with student depression, enabling institutions and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for student well-being.
