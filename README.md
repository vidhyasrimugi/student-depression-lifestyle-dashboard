# STUDENT DEPRESSION & LIFESTYLE DASHBOARD

---

## INTRODUCTION

In today’s fast-paced academic environment, students are exposed to increasing levels of pressure due to academic workload, competitive learning systems, lifestyle imbalance, and excessive use of digital platforms. These factors significantly affect students’ mental health, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression. Educational institutions often lack a consolidated and visual mechanism to monitor these issues at an early stage.

This project titled **“Student Depression & Lifestyle Dashboard”** focuses on analyzing student academic and lifestyle data to identify patterns related to stress and depression. By using data analytics and visualization techniques, the project presents meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard helps educators, counselors, and institutions understand mental health trends and take data-driven decisions to improve student well-being.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

* Analyze student lifestyle and academic data using data analytics techniques
* Identify the relationship between depression and lifestyle factors
* Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) related to stress, sleep, activity, and academics
* Visualize department-wise and gender-wise student behavior
* Design an interactive and user-friendly analytical dashboard
* Support institutional decision-making through visual insights

---

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

* Analysis of a structured student lifestyle and mental health dataset
* Dashboard creation using data visualization tools (Power BI)
* Visualization of stress, sleep, study hours, and social media usage
* Comparative analysis across departments and gender

**Note:** This project is based on historical data and does not include real-time monitoring. However, it can be extended in the future.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset used in this project represents student academic, lifestyle, and mental health information. Each record corresponds to an individual student.

### Dataset Attributes

* **Student_ID** – Unique identifier for each student
* **Age** – Age of the student
* **Gender** – Male / Female
* **Department** – Science, Engineering, Arts, Medical, Business
* **CGPA** – Academic performance indicator
* **Study_Hours** – Average daily study duration
* **Sleep_Duration** – Average sleep hours per day
* **Physical_Activity** – Time spent on physical activities
* **Social_Media_Hours** – Daily social media usage
* **Stress_Level** – Measured stress score
* **Depression** – Mental health status (True / False)

### Data Source

The dataset is collected for academic and analytical purposes and stored in CSV format. It is cleaned and processed before visualization.

---

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

* **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and data visualization
* **Microsoft Excel** – Initial data cleaning and formatting
* **CSV Dataset** – Input data source
* **Data Analytics Techniques** – Aggregation, filtering, and summarization

---

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Hardware Requirements

* Processor: Intel i3 or above
* RAM: Minimum 4 GB
* Storage: Minimum 10 GB free disk space

### Software Requirements

* Microsoft Windows 10 or above
* Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* Microsoft Excel 2016 or later

---

## METHODOLOGY

1. Data Collection – Student lifestyle and academic data collected in CSV format
2. Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and removing inconsistencies
3. Data Processing – Calculating KPIs such as total sleep, stress, and activity
4. Data Analysis – Department-wise and gender-wise analysis using measures
5. Data Visualization – Creating charts, KPIs, and filters
6. Dashboard Design – Integrating all visuals into a single interactive dashboard

---

## DASHBOARD DESCRIPTION

The **Student Depression & Lifestyle Dashboard** provides a comprehensive overview of student mental health and lifestyle behavior.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Total CGPA
* Total Physical Activity
* Total Age
* Total Sleep Duration
* Depression Count vs Non-Depression Count

### Visual Components

* Pie Chart – Stress level by department
* Bar Chart – Stress level, study hours, and social media usage
* Area Chart – Study hours by gender
* Donut Chart – Social media usage by depression status
* Gauge Chart – Sleep duration analysis
* Slicers – Gender and sleep duration filtering

---

## RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

* Engineering and Medical students show slightly higher stress levels
* Increased social media usage correlates with higher stress and depression
* Male students show slightly higher study hours compared to female students
* Students with depression demonstrate significantly higher social media usage
* Sleep duration is below optimal levels for many students

---

## ADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM

* Easy understanding of complex student data
* Interactive and visually appealing dashboard
* Early identification of mental health risk factors
* Reduces manual analysis effort

---

## LIMITATIONS

* Dataset is static and survey-based
* Self-reported data may contain bias
* Depression is represented as a binary value

---

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

* Machine learning-based depression prediction models
* Real-time student mental health monitoring
* Sentiment analysis from feedback and surveys
* Web and mobile dashboard deployment
* Personalized recommendations and alerts

---

## TESTING AND VALIDATION

### Data Validation

* Checked for missing and duplicate records
* Verified calculated KPIs and measures
* Cross-validated dashboard values with raw data

### Functional Testing

* Verified slicers and filters
* Ensured charts update dynamically
* Validated KPI accuracy after filtering

### Performance Testing

* Tested dashboard responsiveness with large datasets
* Ensured smooth interactions and load times

---

## SECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY

* Dataset stored locally with restricted access
* No personal or sensitive identifiers included
* Dashboard shared in read-only mode

---

## USE CASES

* Student mental health monitoring
* Academic stress analysis
* Lifestyle behavior assessment
* Institutional decision-making support

---

## ROLE OF DATA ANALYTICS IN EDUCATION

* Early detection of mental health risks
* Improving student performance and well-being
