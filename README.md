## ❓ Problem Statement

Students today face increasing levels of stress due to academic workload, competitive environments, poor sleep habits, and excessive social media usage. These factors significantly contribute to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. However, identifying these issues early is challenging due to the lack of consolidated and visualized data.

### 🎯 Objective

To design an analytical dashboard that integrates academic, lifestyle, and mental health data to identify patterns related to student depression and lifestyle habits.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

* Analyze the relationship between lifestyle factors and student depression
* Visualize key academic and lifestyle metrics using an interactive dashboard
* Compare stress levels across departments
* Study the impact of sleep duration, study hours, and social media usage
* Provide insights that support mental health awareness and interventions
